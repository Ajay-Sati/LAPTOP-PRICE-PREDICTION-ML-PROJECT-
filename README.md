# LAPTOP PRICE PREDICTION.

The Laptop Price Prediction Machine Learning project is designed to assist users in estimating laptop prices based on input parameters. This project utilizes advanced techniques such as pipelines and column transformers to streamline the data processing workflow.

Users provide input parameters such as specifications, brand, and other relevant features, and the model predicts the laptop's price. The incorporation of pipelines ensures a smooth and efficient flow of data through various processing stages.

One of the key highlights of this project is the use of the Random Forest model, which emerged as the champion model with an impressive accuracy rate of 90%. Random Forest excels in capturing complex relationships within the data, providing robust and reliable predictions for laptop prices.

The column transformer is employed to selectively apply preprocessing steps to different subsets of features, enhancing the model's adaptability to diverse input types. This feature contributes to the overall effectiveness of the machine learning model.
